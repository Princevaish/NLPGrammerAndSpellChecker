## 📝 Project Description

This NLP-based web application helps users detect and correct **spelling and grammar errors** in English text using **TextBlob** and **NLTK**. Designed with a clean **Flask backend**, the app provides a simple interface where users can either **manually input text** or **upload `.txt` files** for automatic correction.

The project leverages the natural language processing power of **TextBlob** to handle common spelling mistakes and uses **NLTK** for basic grammatical analysis such as tokenization and part-of-speech tagging.

### 🔍 What You Can Do:
- ✅ Automatically correct misspelled words
- ✅ Improve basic grammar structure
- ✅ Upload `.txt` files and process them instantly
- ✅ Compare original vs corrected text side-by-side
- ✅ (Optional) Download the corrected version as a new `.txt` file

### 🧠 Technologies Used:
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **NLP Libraries:** TextBlob, NLTK
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (Bootstrap optional)
- **File Support:** Plain `.txt` files (UTF-8)
